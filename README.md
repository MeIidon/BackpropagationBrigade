## Big homework - Milestone 1.

### Identify data source and download scripts.

We are doing the [Flower Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tpu-getting-started) Kaggle competition.

The `get_data.sh` script is used to download the data.

### Data exploration, visualization (if necessary).
